# E2-Telekinesis
Garry's Mod Expression 2 Telekinesis script

This script manipulates the physics of specified spawned props and makes them orbit around the player.
On attack, the furthermost prop is launched in the player's look direction.

It is written in Expression 2, which is a scripting language created for Garry's Mod Wiremod, and was based on Lua.
